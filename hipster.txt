When you work on your project making changes you are dealing with your project’s working directory. This is the project directory on your computer’s filesystem. All the changes you make will remain in the working directory until you add them to the staging area (via git add command). The staging area is best described as a preview of your next commit. Meaning, when you do a git commit, git will take the changes that are in the staging area and make the new commit out of those changes. One practical use of the staging area is that it allows you to fine-tune your commits. You can add and remove changes from staging area until you are satisfied with how your next commit will look like, at which point you can do git commit. And after you commit your changes they go into .git/objects directory where they are saved as commit, blob and tree objects (as we saw when we looked at git’s data model)..
